                    Misdemeanor crimes in Missouri are divided into four main classes, in accordance with their severity.  Additionally, some misdemeanors are unclassified, meaning that they do not fall squarely into one of the four categories.  Read on below for more information related to misdemeanor offenses, including ranges of punishment and collateral consequences.

                    At the Law Office of Shin Cho, our focus goes beyond simply avoiding jail time.  Thatâ€™s because we also recognize that protecting the future of our misdemeanor clients requires more than just the bare minimum of keeping you out of jail.  Oftentimes, there are a lot more important things at stake, such as future education or employment opportunities.  Many schools and employers require that you disclose your criminal history in the application process, and some will even run a criminal background check to verify your answers.  This is especially so in the professional sector, as many jobs require that you have a professional license that is issued by a quasi-governmental licensing board.  Examples include <span><a href="https://pr.mo.gov/boards/nursing/FrequentlyAskedQuestions.pdf">nursing boards</a></span>,  
                    <span> <a href="https://pr.mo.gov/physiciansandsurgeons-forms.asp">physician licensing boards</a></span>,
