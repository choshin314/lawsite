Not being with the firm anymore, he could have easily just pointed me back towards his old firm to help sort it out. Instead he took it on himself, for free, and sorted it out no questions asked. I am also an extremely busy person with my career, so it is important to me to be able to communicate efficiently, and often at non-standard business hours. Shin made that easy and I didn't even have to ask. Right from the start he was accessible to me when I needed him to be and was always quick to reply by phone, email, or text. There is no doubt that Shin is a fine lawyer, but it is the little things that separate Shin and make him a cut above the rest. ",

I found Shin on Avvo and during our first email exchange - he immediately calmed me down. He listened engagingly to my story, got all the details, asked what my ideal outcome would be and then gave me some different scenarios based on the knowledge & information he had. He executed on exactly what needed to be done and ended up getting charges dropped and never having to go to court and just having to paying a fine. Not only did Shin get what I wanted out of court - but he listened and followed through on every interaction we had and gave me peace of mind that my case was being taken care of while explaining each step. I couldn't give a higher recommendation and he is your guy if you are in the \"my life is over\" thinking I was in when searching for a lawyer.",
